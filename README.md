## Minimalist Music Player

### The idea is to create a music player that takes music from your computer and allows you to create dynamic playlists as well as perform other standard music streaming functions, in a minimalist web setting

#### Maybe to Be Implemented:

- Allow Access from any computer by creating a server that stores user music
- Allow dynamic input of music sources, so client does not need to modify code
